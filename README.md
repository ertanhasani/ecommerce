This is my first project in .net Core and it definitely has many flaws and I messed it up.
It is here that maybe someone needs to use it and that there is a history of my work.

This is a fork from https://github.com/ertanhasani/ecommerce

# E-Commerce
E-Commerce application written in ASP.NET Core 6.0 (MVC) and MSSQL

## Database
Run `full.sql` in your database and it will create a database.

## Backend
If you need to change the connection string you can do it by going to `application.json` file.

Execute `dotnet run` in CMD and the application will start running.

**ENJOY!**
